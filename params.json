For both types of links, the text you want to display to the user is placed in square brackets. For example, if you want your link to display the text “GitHub”, you write [GitHub].\r\n\r\nTo create an inline link, create a set of parentheses immediately after the brackets and write your URL within the parentheses. (e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com/)). Relative paths are allowed in inline links.\r\n\r\nTo create a reference link, use two sets of square brackets. [[my internal link|internal-ref]] will link to the internal reference internal-ref.",
  "note": "Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."
